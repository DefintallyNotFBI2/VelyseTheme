# VelyseTheme
Works well with most languages(so long it's .net or has a addon allowing .net desktop enviroment libaries), I've messed around using it with C++ (using the .net desktop enviroment for C++ addon in visual studio)
I remember using themes in the past and my main issue was how I was un-able to change things in properties to my liking, so I decided to make most of it public inside the code, easily accesible in the properties window or the code itself! for instance, round or square windows/tools, show or dont show percentages etc
Hope you enjoy it!
Please let me know in discussion or otherwise if you find any bugs or problems, would be happy to update/fix or if you got any ideas you want me to add too it(will give you credit)

Currently I'm just doing this as a hobby and too re-learn programming. This was orginally made in VB.Net but I've lost the code for it (might find it in my dropbox)
all you have too do is find the dll, add it into your respotory or drag it into your toolbox, wabang there's some nice looking interface for you!
If you see some blurr or graphical oddities - its most likely a driver issue (happened in the past) 

Btw most of the code is copied from the web, especially the circular progress bar; I found it long ago(5 years ago) and at the time the code was almost 15 years old! it was so outdated the methods simply don't work with current .net versions, so I just updated, fixed it and made it look nice and smooth (mainly the math behind the cirlularity was copied). I'm a busy person with my job, but will be adding credit where it's due soon! (Not like the younger me lol)
